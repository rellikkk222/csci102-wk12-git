PrintOutput
This was taken form the week 10 function file that was created. 

LoadFile
This was created using a simple open command and printing the file as text in an output.

UpdateString
This function will find the specified position in the string and replace it with the value. It uses the principle of breaking and adding to the string. 

FindWordCount
I use the same principle used in weeks 8's assignment. By counting the word by line it makes the funcion operate faster. 

ScoreFinder
Uses the principle of index matching. If the position of one object is found, it will return the value in the second list in the same position. If not found it will provide an error. 

Union
This uses the set function to find similarities in the two file. Those similarities are then subtracted from the second list and appended to the first. 

Intersection
Using a for loop to determine what values exist in both lists, and returning those values. 

NotIn
I went for the set function to match items in both lists, and then delete out what is the same.
